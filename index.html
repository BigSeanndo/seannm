Currently in my second year at Edinburgh Napier University, I am pursuing a degree in cyber-security.

This field fascinates me with its constant evolution and significant role in protecting our digital world.
<br><br>
My interests extend beyond academics. I practice mixed martial arts, a discipline that enhances both my physical strength and mental resilience.

Additionally, playing the drums offers me a creative escape, balancing the demands of my studies.

I also enjoy hiking, finding peace and rejuvenation in nature's landscapes. 

This hobby helps me unwind and gain perspective.
<br><br>
Overall, my journey as a cyber-security student is shaped by a combination of academic dedication, physical activity, musical passion, and a love for the outdoors.

Each of these elements plays a vital role in my personal and professional growth.

        <p>As a cybersecurity student, I've cultivated a strong foundation in various programming languages, including C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and BASH, each offering a unique perspective in the vast domain of cyber technology. My proficiency in SQL also further helps my ability to secure and manage databases effectively.
<br><br>
Penetration testing is a crucial component of my skill set. Utilizing web developer tools, I've gained hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting system vulnerabilities. Tools such as nmap have become instrumental in my understanding of network security, allowing me to navigate and analyze complex network infrastructures.
<br><br>
Frameworks like Metasploit are a regular part of my toolkit, enabling me to systematically discover and exploit security flaws. This practical application of theoretical knowledge has been a cornerstone of my learning experience.
<br><br>
In the realm of technology, my capabilities extend to using advanced tools like Burp Suite and Wireshark. These resources are essential for deep network analysis, offering insights into the intricacies of data transmission and network behavior.
<br><br>
A significant aspect of my educational journey has been the exploration of Cisco's networking hardware and software. This experience has provided me with a robust understanding of the hardware and software solutions that form the backbone of modern networking infrastructures.
<br><br>
Linux, known for its versatility and security features, is another area where I have developed considerable expertise. My proficiency in Linux not only enhances my technical skillset but also reinforces my operational security (OPSEC) practices, ensuring the safeguarding of information and the maintenance of privacy in digital environments.
