                <p>Welcome! I am a dedicated second-year cybersecurity student at ENU, where I specialize in Artificial Intelligence and computer automation.<br>
				My academic focus is on leveraging these technologies to enhance cybersecurity solutions.<br>
				Professionally, I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including C, C++, Python, Java, and BASH. This diverse programming expertise is complemented by my practical knowledge in network setup, management, and the ethical use of Kali Linux-based hacking tools.<br>
				My approach is always guided by a strong adherence to ethical practices and professional standards in cybersecurity.<br>
				In addition to my technical skills, I bring a unique blend of extracurricular experiences to my professional endeavors. With years of dedicated practice in martial arts, I have developed a discipline and resilience that fuel my work ethic. As a drummer and competitive dancer, I have honed my ability to perform under pressure.<br>
				My enthusiasm for outdoor activities further reflects my commitment to maintaining a balanced lifestyle, which I believe is essential for sustained professional performance and creativity.<br>
				As I continue to advance in my cybersecurity studies, I am keen to apply my diverse skill set in real-world scenarios. I am open to collaboration and eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology and security.<br><br>
				I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities to contribute to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.</p>
